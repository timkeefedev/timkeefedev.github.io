### Purpose of this blog

Many blogs related to software engineering post articles describing solutions or coding patterns/concepts - basically attempting to provide answers.

This blog will probably have some of those types of articles, but it I expect a few posts will conclude with new questions or some still unanswered questions.  Currently this blog is not about being an authority on subject matter, it is simply about exploring the JavaScript language.  All constructive comments are welcome!
