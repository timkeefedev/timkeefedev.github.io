## Organizing the Landscape to Identify Potential Markets
### A Viewpoint from 10,000 Feet

I am attempting to tell a story of what the “blockchain” innovation is and where it fits into a technology landscape. In addition, I try to describe why this innovation is important and how it creates value.

In order to put this all together, I build a theoretical model from within an economic context — transaction costs and agency costs. This model gives the reader, particularly those not familiar with economic theory, another perspective from which to understand and think more prudently about applying this innovation to the specific business challenge they are trying to solve.

The full article [Look Before You Leap] (https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkK6MPQfI8Skf79BAMVctDvO8Pw2HiiFEFVPMp5aCog/edit?usp=sharing) is available on my Google drive. It is roughly 4100 words and should be about a 20–25 minute read. Among other things, the article includes links to blog posts with specific tools for determining if you should use blockchain technology.
