## Organizing the Landscape to Identify Potential Markets
### A Viewpoint from 10,000 Feet

I am attempting to tell a story of what the “blockchain” innovation is and where it fits into a technology landscape. In addition, I try to describe why this innovation is important and how it creates value.

In order to put this all together, I build a theoretical model from within an economic context — transaction costs and agency costs. This model gives the reader, particularly those not familiar with economic theory, another perspective from which to understand and think more prudently about applying this innovation to the specific business challenge they are trying to solve.

The full article [Look Before You Leap](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkK6MPQfI8Skf79BAMVctDvO8Pw2HiiFEFVPMp5aCog/edit?usp=sharing) is available on my Google drive. It is roughly 4100 words and should be about a 20–25 minute read. Among other things, the article includes links to blog posts with specific tools for determining if you should use blockchain technology.

It describes:
* _How code will be parsed by the compiler._
* _How data items will be stored and accessed._
* _How data items will be processed by the runtime._

It illustrates how JavaScript code pattern/structures manipulate your data, which should lead to a better understanding of:

* _Why a particular concept is useful in your program._
* _Why a certain code pattern is used to implement the concept in your program._


Some Highlights
— 3 Take Aways and the Technology Tree Diagram

1. The story of blockchain is a tale about databases. The main character is a new type of database software running on a distributed computer network.
* _The distributed network is a peer-to-peer network._
* _The software employs consensus algorithms that enable the computers to create trust amongst themselves and thus become the trusted validation system — no need for a human based agency system to do this function any longer._
* _Blockchain is located on the Database software branch of my Technology Tree (see below.) It is a grand child of Distributed Ledgers._
