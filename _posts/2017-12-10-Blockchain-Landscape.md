### Organizing the Landscape to Identify Potential Markets
### One Viewpoint from 10,000 Feet

I am attempting to tell a story of what the “blockchain” innovation is and where it fits into a technology landscape. In addition, I try to describe why this innovation is important and how it creates value.

In order to put this all together, I build a theoretical model from within an economic context — transaction costs and agency costs. This model gives the reader, particularly those not familiar with economic theory, another perspective from which to understand and think more prudently about applying this innovation to the specific business challenge they are trying to solve.

The full article …Look Before You Leap is available on my Google drive. It is roughly 4100 words and should be about a 20–25 minute read. Among other things, the article includes links to blog posts with specific tools for determining if you should use blockchain technology.
Some Highlights


I have compiled and organized the notes that I jotted down on my journey to understanding JavaScript.  

I think this guide is a lot different than most guides/books because it attempts to explain JavaScript within a generalized model of a compiler and runtime environment, stepping you through what happens to your code when you hit “GO”.

It describes:
* _How code will be parsed by the compiler._
* _How data items will be stored and accessed._
* _How data items will be processed by the runtime._
