### A Guide to Understanding How JavaScript Actually Works

I have compiled and organized the notes that I jotted down on my journey to understanding JavaScript.  

I think this guide is a lot different than most guides/books because it attempts to explain JavaScript within a generalized model of a compiler and runtime environment, stepping you through what happens to your code when you hit “GO”.

It describes:
* _How code will be parsed by the compiler._
* _How data items will be stored and accessed._
* _How data items will be processed by the runtime._
