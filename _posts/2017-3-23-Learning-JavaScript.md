### A Guide to Understanding How JavaScript Actually Works

I have compiled and organized the notes that I jotted down on my journey to understanding JavaScript.  

I think this guide is a lot different than most guides/books because it attempts to explain JavaScript within a generalized model of a compiler and runtime environment, stepping you through what happens to your code when you hit “GO”.

It describes:
* _How code will be parsed by the compiler._
* _How data items will be stored and accessed._
* _How data items will be processed by the runtime._

It illustrates how JavaScript code pattern/structures manipulate your data, which should lead to a better understanding of:

* _Why a particular concept is useful in your program._
* _Why a certain code pattern is used to implement the concept in your program._

The guide has 17 separate sections, with each section consisting of several pages of text, code samples and diagrams.
Here is a quick outline of the topics covered:


### Overview

#### __Introduction__

  Describing the JavaScript language and outlining the important concepts.  
  Part 0. Describing a JavaScript run time model

#### __Creating Environments__
*   #### Part A. Writing Code - the Basics
      Variables and Assigning Value Types    
1.    Primitives Values          
2.    Objects Values
*     The Object Object Value Type
*     The Function Object Value Type
  
      Lexical Environments and Scope      
      Execution Contexts      
      Methods      
      //Constructors - covered in Writing Code - Environments      
      //Closure - covered in Writing Code - Environments
      

*   #### Part B.  Executing Code
    Hoisting    
    Storing, Copying, Comparing and Passing Different Value Types/Variables    
    The Scope Chain

*   #### Part C.  Writing Code - Environments and Managing Value Types/Variables
    Understanding the “this” keyword    
    Understanding Constructors (classes)    
    Managing memory usage    
    Managing variable assignment    
    Understanding Closure    
1.    A consequence of JavaScript’s Lexical Scoping mechanism    
2.    Enables functions as “first class” object capabilities manage:    
  *     the visibility of variables upon function invocation and    
  *     the timing of function invocation
